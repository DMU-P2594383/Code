<!--The body tag contains all of the content that appears on the webpage. Within my index.html document it features the movie
synopsis and the trailer for the film. My chosen film was 'Night of the Living Dead'. I've used semantic html elements such as
<header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer> to seperate key parts of the website and improve accessibility. I have also used <div>
attributes to create "containers" using the class attribute, this allowed me to create blocks for each section and directly
edit the contents of each block.-->
  <body>
<!--HEADER - This is the main header of the website, I used the <h1> attribute for some simple text stating the movie title.-->
    <header class="header">
      <h1 class="h1header">Night of the Living Dead</h1>
    </header>
<!--TOPNAV - This section here acts as a hub for both the "home" & "cast" pages. They are placed within a <nav> attribute that
seperate navigation links from other attributes and sections on the page. Navigation allows more accessibility for users with
disabilities as it can tell screen readers and other aparatus that these are used to navagate pages. I also added an extenal
link to the IMDb page for the movie. Finally, I added these links to a "topnav" class and each link has been added to a "link"
class for use in CSS, where I used flexbox display to alter the way the links look.-->
    <nav class="topnav">
      <a class="link" href="index.html">Home</a>
      <a class="link" href="casting.html">Cast</a>
      <a class="link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/">IMDb</a>
    </nav>
<!--SYNOPSIS - In this section I placed the synopsis of the film with a heading. All of the attributes are placed into a <section>
which is another semantic html attribute. Sections usually contain headings with complementary text alongside them. Similar to <nav>
sections tell the browser what it is and allows other programs to read the text. The heading and paragraph are placed in another
"container", where I used a <div> and allows me to edit the surrounding space seperately to the other elements within the <div>.-->
    <section class="synopsis">
      <div class="indexblock">
        <h2>What is the plot?</h2>
          <p>
            Widley considered the first 'zombie flick' that follows the modern zombie 'stereotypes', Night of the Living Dead is a
            film where people must survive the zombie outbreak directed by George A. Romero. After visting a cemetery to pay respects,
            Johnny and Barbara (Judith O'Dea) are suddenly confronted by...the UNDEAD! During the commotion Barbara and Johnny split up.
            Wandering alone Barbara stumbles accross a house where other survivors are held up. Among them are 'Ben' (Duane Jones),
            'Harry Cooper' (Karl Hardman) and 'Helen Cooper' (Marilyn Eastman). They must survive the outbreak but what will come of
            them?
          </p>
      </div>
    </section>
<!--TRAILER - Here is where I placed the film trailer for the website. I wrapped the video source code within a container
<div> classed as "trailer". I placed <source> attributes within a <video> attribute using three different video formats. These
allow the video to be played on different browsers as certain browsers only use some of the available video formats. I mainly ran
my pages using Firefox, which supports MP4, OGV and WEBM. However, other browsers such as Safari and older versions of modern
browsers don't support some formats. E.g. Safari only supports the MP4 format. Each link has been given "alt" text that tells
accessibility programs what the video is. Futhermore, I have also included a fallback link to the video if it does not load,
which can happen on older versions of browsers.-->
    <div class="trailer">
      <video controls alt="Night Of The Living Dead Trailer" poster="img/livingdeadposter.jpg" width="800px" height="600px">
        <source src="vid/nightofthelivingdeadtrailer.mp4" type="video/mp4" alt="Night Of The Living Dead Trailer">
        <source src="vid/nightofthelivingdeadtrailer.ogv" type="video/ogg" alt="Night Of The Living Dead Trailer">
        <source src="vid/nightofthelivingdeadtrailer.webm" type="video/webm" alt="Night Of The Living Dead Trailer">
        Your browser does not support this video tag. Click <a href="vid/nightofthelivingdeadtrailer.mp4">here</a> for the video in MP4 format.
      </video>
    </div>
<!--I added a <br> or "break" attribute that simply seperates two attributes and creates space between them-->
    <br>
<!--BOTTOMNAV - I placed some navigation links at the bottom of the webpage within the <footer> (another semantic html attribute).
Similar to the topnav; the bottomnav has been placed into "classes" that allowed my to edit there appearance within CSS using
flexbox. This was to emulate footer links on other websites.-->
    <footer class="footer">
      <nav class="bottomnav">
        <a class="footerlink" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/">IMDb</a>
        <a class="footerlink" href="https://livingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead">FANDOM</a>
        <a class="footerlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead">WIKIPEDIA</a>
      </nav>
<!--WATERMARK - This <div> class contains the watermark for my website including my P Number, Name, Module and date. I used a
<label> and placed this all in a "container" to edit this within CSS using flexbox. The idea behind this was to create some-
thing similar to the footer's of actual websites, that usually include copyright infomation and so on.-->
      <div class="watermark">
        <label class="wmark" >P2594383 - Made by Samual Richardson, Multimedia 1, 2020-2021</label>
      </div>
    </footer>
