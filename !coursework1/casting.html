down elements within the page to a mobile view. If this was not present; mobile devices would use the default widths for desktop and
cause the site's UI (user interface) to suffer. The second one allowed me to create a seperate CSS file (stylesheet) to change the
appearance of the site using CSS code.
Psst. This can also be placed within the "head" or within specific html elements such as videos and images.-->
