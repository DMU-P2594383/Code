      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! This has been created using everything I have learned over the past month.
        It's purpose is to show that the infomation and techniques that I have been practicing can used
        in a practical way. So I have added everything from videos to audio files to working with CSS and
        styling, this website should show a good example of my capabilities.

      <h2>The Module</h2>
      <p>
        This module is all about the different aspects of web design, so far we have been focusing on HTML
        (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). These are forms of coding that make
        up most websites on the internet. HTML is the bulk of the code that is used to program most of the
        content such as text, image, video and audio among other things. CSS is code that is used alongside this and as the
        name suggests; it is used to change the 'style' of the website.

    <!-- Used a blockquote to place a citation and a website. Blockquotes appear
         differently when placed inside paragraphs; making them easier to
         recognise.-->

      <p>
        Next term we will be delving into 'Python', which is in my opinion on a completely other level
        compared to html and css. <strong>Code Institute</strong> describes it as...
        <blockquote cite="https://codeinstitute.net/blog/what-is-python-used-for/">
          'It's often used as a 'scripting language' for web applications. This means that it can automate
          specific series of tasks, making it more efficient.'
        </blockquote>
        This means we will learn how to create code that may or may not perform automated tasks (if this
        is correct :) )

    <!--I used the <div> tag to also act as a way to seperate sections of the code. Here I used it to
     section out the footer. I used <a> anchor links embedded in <p> paragraphs to creat a coherent sentence
     with clickable buttons that take you to relevant websites.-->
