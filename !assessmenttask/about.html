      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
       Hello, my name is Samual Richardson and I am studying my first year of Media Production BSc here at De Montfort University!
       I was born on the 27th of August 2002 in Bradford Royal Infirmary, which is the main hospital in the city of Bradford. I grew up
       in Saltaire, a town to the north of the city for about half my life (be it in different homes). Life was tough due to my mother's
       diabetes and I had to learn from a young age to care for her. I've been told personally that I have saved my mother's life many
       times from the age of three-years-old!

       Growing up at Hirst Wood Cresent was fun, I used to ride my bike everyday, play video games like Halo (thanks to my uncle!) and
       developed my love for criminology from a young age watching CSI among other things.
      </p>

      <h2>Later Life</h2>
      <p>
        Me, my mother and my sister had to move out of our home due to 'issues', I went through my Primary school years (I can't remember
        most of this). After a couple of years we moved into a new house with my step-dad who I consider my 'real' father (for certain
        reasons). During this time I lived nearby to my best friends from Primary School, which was a real treat as I was able to socialise
        lots (something I miss). But eventually we had to move out and we moved in to the house that we have lived in and my family still
        live in now.

        It was around this time when I began to attend St Bede's Catholic Grammar school

      </figure>
        Over my time in school I tried to study my subjects to the best of my abilities. In my early years there I enjoyed science, media
        and english. I began to love english and media related subjects more and more. My secondary school years were not all well though.
        I was singled out for most of my years there due to bullying, which led me to the library, one of my safe havens. And though what
        brought me there was horrible, I am thankful for it now. Here is where I developedmy long lasting friendships (who I'm still
        friends with now). I began to read alot and develop my character. Some of my favourites included graphic novels, manga and horror.
        My love of criminology began to brew once again, anime became a new contender in my media consumption and chess became a past-time
        of mine.

        During Years 10 & 11 I studied 9 GCSEs, being in a catholic school it was compulsory to study religious educaction. Alongside this
         I studied the core subjects (Maths, English and Science) and as my chosen subjects I studied History, Geography, Media
        and Photography. Once I moved to my sixth form I decided to study A Level Photogrphy as well as Criminology & Law. Whilst studying
        criminology and law I learned more complex ways of studying, citing previous cases and laws. However, my photography was my creative
        oulet. Allowing me to create and adapt my own works through cameras and other photography equipment. In my spare time I messed around
        with many different applications such as Photoshop, Ilustrator, Premiere among others to develop the skills to use them. Which is really
        helping me in the course right now as I have self-taught myself to use them.

        And now I am here at University, trying to study my hardest to pass with the best possible grade I can. I'm a little stressed
        about what is to come but overall I am happy and prepared to create some of my best works yet.
