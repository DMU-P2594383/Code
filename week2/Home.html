    <h1>Media Production BSc</h1>
    <p>My name is Samual Richardson and I'm a first year student studying <strong> Media Production BSc at De Montfort University!</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>'I'm, <strong>(so far!)</strong> really enjoying the course, especially the <strong>Image Capture & Processing</strong> module. <strong>(This one too!) </strong> <br> It is quite challenging but I believe I will engage quite well within all my modules.'</p>

    <h2> What are the names of the core modules? </h2>
    <ol type="I" style="color: #E72A2A">
      <li> Social Media & Innovation </li>
      <li> Multimedia </li>
      <li> Image Capture & Processing </li>
      <li> Audio Capture & Processing </li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Why is the course great? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> I have really helpful lecturers and teaching staff to help me. </li>
      <li> The facilities are really good and up to standard. </li>
      <li> The course is fun! It is allowing me to discover new things and improve on the skills I already have. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Currently, this week I have learned how to create lists using html. I have used a mixture of <strong> organised & unorganised </strong> lists. I figured out how to change the colour and the icons to roman numerals.
      Furthermore, in my spare time I researched into CSS techniques so I am prepared for the upcoming tasks. Hopefully the header has it's own background, this body of text is aligned and the background has changed colour.
      I have also learned how to change the text values such as letter spacing, line spacing, word spacing, white spacing, text shadows and text decoration! (have not imputed text shadow or decoration). Personally, I believe I have made good progress for week 2 in the course! </p>

      <blockquote> P.S. This looks way better on mobile! </blockquote>
