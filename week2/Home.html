      <p>'I am, <strong>(so far!)</strong> really enjoying the course especially the <strong>Image Capture & Processing</strong> module. <br> It is quite challenging but I believe I will engage quite well within all my modules.'</p>

    <h2> What are the names of the core modules? </h2>
    <ol type="I" style="color: #E72A2A">
      <li> Social Media & Innovation </li>
      <li> Multimedia </li>
      <li> Image Capture & Processing </li>
      <li> Audio Capture & Processing </li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Why is the course great? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> I have really helpful lecturers and teaching staff to help me. </li>
      <li> The facilities are really good and up to standard. </li>
      <li> The course is fun! It is allowing me to discover new things and improve on the skills I already have. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Currently, this week I have learn't how to create lists using html. I have used a mixture of <strong> organised & unorganised </strong> lists. I figured out how to change the colour and the icons to roman numerals.
      Furthermore, in my spare time I researched into CSS techniques so I am prepared for the upcoming tasks. Hopefully the header has it's own background, this body of text is aligned to the center and the background has changed colour.
      Personally, I believe I have made good progress for week 2 in the course! </p>
