    <!--Header:
  This is a header indicated by the <header> tags. This acts as the 'bar' at the top of a website where the links to
the other pages are placed i.e. home, about, contact etc. This can also include a 'menu' which can drop down to show
links.

Anchors:
Indicated by the <a> tag they allow hyperlinks to be made with the other pages of a website, other websites, emails,
phone numbers etc. This can be done like the one below. <a indicates the anchor, href="" includes the link be it to
another website where you have to place the whole url. i.e https://

Alternatively, you can link to somewhere within the website by placing the folder/filename.html within the area where
the link would be placed, this is called a relative link.-->

    <h1>THE AUDIO & VIDEO SITE!</h1>
      <p>This site features some audio and video files. Feel free to browse our
         very small selection of nature related audio and video file.</p>

<!--Audio Element:
This is the audio element.It allows audio files to be played in a website. There are 3 main audio file types that can
 be used. These are .mp3, .wav and .ogg. In the code I have specified that these are audio files by using the <audio> tag.
"Source" code allows me to add the files in that I want, src="" is where the folder name and filename are placed with the
  file type and media type (type="audio/wav").

Within the audio tag you can place 'controls' which allow the audio to appear on the website. You can also add a fallback
message if the audio file does not show up

Audio attributes include: controls, autoplay, loop, muted, preload and the src= attribute.-->
<div>
  <p>This is an audio clip of the woods during a windy day</p>
 <audio controls>
   <source src="aud/windywoods.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   <source src="aud/windywoods.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
   <source src="aud/windywoods.wav" type="audio/wav">
 </audio>
</div>

<!--Video element:
 These are video elements and are similar to the audio elements in terms of layout. They allow videos to be placed into
 your website in the form of .mp4, .webm or .ogg files. Before you enter source code you have to embed them with a video
 element i.e <video>. Within this you 'embed' source elements. This is <source src="folder/file" type="video/type">.

 Additionally, you can again place a fallback if the video doesn't load with a message and link.

 Additionally, controls can be added to the video so it shows up on the website. These include src, poster, autoplay,
 muted, preload, autoplay, height and width. These can change the way it appears on the website and the same goes for
 audio files.

      <p>Sorry, but your browser could not access this audio file. Maybe
        this is due to your system or the browser itself being out of date.

 <!-- Footer:
I created a seperate tag <footer> to make an area simiar to the header of a website where anchors <a> can be placed
to link other websites or sections of the page. Here I made a link to another website online.

<a href="website link">the clickable thing (text or image)</a>                                                   -->
