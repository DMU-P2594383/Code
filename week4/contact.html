    <!--Anchors cont:
  Here is an example of an anchor that links directly to an email address or phone number. Use code from the Anchors
before but this time there is something you can do. If you place a 'mailto:' after <a href= and add an email it will
open an email appliction on the person's device with the address opened already. Alternatively, you can add a telephone
number using 'tel:' after the '<a href=' with the area code and phone number e.g. tel:+4472343748. -->

      <!-- Lists:
    Two types of lists ordered <ol> and unordered <ul>. Unordered lists only use bullet points to sort the list. However,
  ordered lists can use numbers i.e. 1. 2. 3. Alternatively, you can change an ordered list to roman numerals by placing
'type="I"' within the <ol> element. Example. <ol type="I"                                                            -->
